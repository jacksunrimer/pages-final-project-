The Laser Clay Shooting System was released by Nintendo in 1973, which was a simulated gun that would shoot light to interact with a target. This was the start of the path Nintendo would take for the next five decades to come!</p>

                        <p class="lead"><br>Released in 1977, the ‘Color TV-Game’ is Nintendo’s first video game console to be released. It was one of five home consoles originally sold by Nintendo from 1977 - 1980. It featured six variations of the game pong on it, which they licensed from the creator Magnavox. Despite its success, Nintendo was competing with the big names in the business, Bandai and Tomy, which hurt early video game sales in the late 1970s.</p>

Nintendo brought Shigeru Miyamoto onto their team to lead their next development of arcade games. This led to the creation of the game Donkey Kong, a revolutionary game that allowed much more freedom of the character being played. The player could run left and right, and could jump over obstacles.</p>

This marked the end of Nintendo’s career as a toy manufacturer and their new strategy of home entertainment through video games. As much as 25% of American households in 1989 owned a Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>
